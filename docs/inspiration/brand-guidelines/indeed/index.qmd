## Typography

Indeed uses a proprietary font called "Indeed Sans" for its brand.
[Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) is a close match and is available on Google Fonts, so we're using that here.

```{.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
typography:
  fonts:
    - family: Work Sans
      source: google
  base: Work Sans
  headings:
    color: gray-100
  link:
    color: blue
```
