```{python}
#| echo: false
from brand_yml._utils_yaml import yaml_brand as yaml
from IPython.display import Markdown

with open("_brand-nhs-r.yml", "r") as f:
    brand = yaml.load(f)

meta = yaml.dump({"meta": brand["meta"]}).strip()
logo = yaml.dump({"logo": brand["logo"]}).strip()
color = yaml.dump({"color": brand["color"]}).strip()
typography = yaml.dump({"typography": brand["typography"]}).strip()
```

``` {.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
`{python} Markdown(meta)`
```

## Colour

NHS-R Community uses the NHS England colours for its branding under the OGL v3.0 licence.
The colours used by NHS-R Community do not, currently, include any colours from any other nation in the UK.

``` {.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
`{python} Markdown(color)`
```

## Typography

The `_brand.yml` includes commented code for the use of [Frutiger, the official NHS font](https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/identity-guidelines/fonts/), but this is not used in any NHS-R Community products as this requires purchasing.
If this is available to an NHS organisation then the lines of code under `fonts:` need to be uncommented and the output tested.

The recommended NHS font to use is Arial and this is the default font used by NHS-R Community.

``` {.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
`{python} Markdown(typography)`
```

## Logo

It should be noted that the [logo for the NHS in England](https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/identity-guidelines/nhs-logo/) is protected by law and is trade marked so can be used by official documents in the work of the NHS.
In order to use this please just replace the NHS-R Community logo with that of NHS.

The NHS-R Community logo incorporates the R logo available under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International licence and copies of [NHS-R Community's logo](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/assets/tree/main/logo) are available under Creative Commons 1.0.

``` {.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
`{python} Markdown(logo)`
```
