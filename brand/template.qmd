## About

Individual formats and outputs can expose format-specific variables or options that are relevant to themes, but that can't be set globally.

For example, [Quarto slides expose a set of Sass variables](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/themes.html#sass-variables) while HTML documents and Shiny apps [use Sass variables set by Bootstrap](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/bs5-variables/index.html).

On the other hand, some theme-relevant settings are actually format options, or are built on top of a base of format options.
For example, when creating a branded Beamer presentation, its often easier to start with a known `theme` or `colortheme`.
Or similarly, it might be easier in Bootstrap to start with a [Bootswatch theme](https://bootswatch.com/).

A source of inspiration for this section is [pkgdown's approach to template packaging](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/customise.html#template-packages), where a source template provides the initial values for `_pkgdown.yml` settings that can be overridden in local instances.
In this regard, the `template` section provides a template for the initial values of format- or output-specific settings.
An alternative name for this section could be `settings`.


## Example

```{.yaml filename="brand.yml"}
template:
  format:
    html:
      toc: true
      toc-location: left
    beamer:
      navigation: horizontal
      theme: AnnArbor
      colortheme: lily
  bootstrap:
    defaults:
      enable-rounded: false
      link-decoration: none
  website:

```

## Spec

```{.yaml}
{{< include spec/brand-template.yml >}}
```

### Bootstrap

Some of the most basic non-color concepts found in

* <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/options/>
* <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/css-variables/>

If we have a `template.bootstrap` field, it would support the named section used by [theme Sass files in Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes-more.html).


#### HTML basic options

Example from [Quarto HTML documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#basic-options):

```{.markdown}

  html: 
    theme: cosmo
    fontsize: 1.1em
    linestretch: 1.7
